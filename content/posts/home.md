Hi, my name is Go Frendi Gunawan. Currently I work as Backend Engineer at kata.ai.

In this blog, you will find some articles related to software engineering, machine learning, and mathematics.

The articles are intended for `mere mortal`.  Some basic programming/high school math are going to help, but are not required.
